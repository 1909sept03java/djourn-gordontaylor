                        <h1>What are MetaHumans?</h1>
                        <p style="padding: 2%;"> Meta-humans, commonly shortened as metas and often referred to as super-humans, are individuals who acquired powers and abilities unlike those of normal humans after experiencing mutation of their bodies (in comparison to magic
                            users, who learned how to harness primordial energies without being mutated themselves). On Earth-27, meta-humans are referred to as hyperhumans.[1] Most obtained their powers after surviving an explosion caused by a malfunction
                            of the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator on December 11th, 2013, releasing a wave of dark matter throughout Central City. These people were exposed to the particles and dark matter that altered their genetic, chemical, or
                            even atomic structure, giving them a variety of abilities. Their abilities seem to often relate to what energy or matter the future super-humans were directly in contact with at the time of exposure. According to Clifford DeVoe,
                            approximately 2,600 people became meta-humans the night of the accelerator explosion. Only certain people became metas as only a handful of people in Central City carried a unique and dormant "meta-gene" that allows the pituitary
                            gland to process dark matter in order to manifest stable abilities. Team Flash has recently developed a cure for meta abilities that involves suppressing this gene to remove the meta's ability to process dark matter and the
                            powers they gain from it. On Earth-2, intending to prevent the negative effects of the particle accelerator, Dr. Harrison Wells of that universe allowed excess radiation to flow underground, with the first meta-human appearing
                            eleven hours following.[2]</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-4 clo-md-6 col-sm-12 " style="min-width: 50%;">
                        <p style="padding-top: 16%;">Meta-humans are represented by a wide spectrum of mutated people, with mental state, physical appearance and physiological specifics unique for each individual. The conditions they were in during the exposure to the mutative element
                            seem to affect how the mutation changes a person. Furthermore, there are dormant meta-humans, like Henry Hewitt and Jefferson Jackson, whose powers did not resurface until the connection to the Firestorm Matrix, which either
                            re-enabled their mutative physiology or represented a new mutation altogether.[3] Within the spectrum of meta-humans, there have emerged a few specific classes or sub-species that share common traits and powers; speedsters,
                            for example, are meta-humans who are connected to the Speed Force and collectively possess speed-based powers. Vibers are another example; meta-humans who possess psychic connections to the dimensional energies of reality,
                            allowing them to open breaches to parallel universes at will, generate vibrational energy and giving them powers of retrocognition, clairvoyance, and precognition.</p>
